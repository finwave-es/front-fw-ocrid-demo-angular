# OCR ID Integration Angular

This project demonstrates how to integrate the `fw-ocrid` library into an Angular application to perform real-time OCR document scanning using a camera.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Integrate `fw-ocrid` with Angular.
- Create a modern and functional user interface.
- Capture, process, and display OCR scan results.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Angular Standalone Components
- TypeScript
- fw-ocrid SDK
- HTML5 / CSS3

The user must enter their API Key and Regula License:
- These values are validated and OcrId is correctly instantiated.

2. OCR Activation

Once the credentials are applied:
- The user can start the OCR scan.
- The camera feed is displayed in real-time within a `<div #container>`.
